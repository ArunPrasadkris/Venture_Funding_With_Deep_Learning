# Venture_Funding_With_Deep_Learning
Module 13 Challenge

This Deep Learning project utilizes a neural network to predict the liklihood of success amongst startups applying for venture funding. The data, imported from the CSV file, contains 34,000 applicants who have received funding in the past. The venture capitol firm, Alphabet Soup, can use this data and neural network to aid their investment decisions for future applicants.

## Technologies
This project uses Google Colab and the standard Python 3.8 libraries. This project requires the following libraries and/or dependencies:

*Pandas - a software library designed for open source data analysis and manipulation.
*Path - implements path objects as first-class entities, allowing common operations on files to be *invoked on those path objects directly.
*sklearn - HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple.
*Tensorflow - TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

## Methods
To complete this deep nerual network, the following steps were performed:

Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model.
Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model Using a Neural Network.
Optimize the Neural Network Model.
After finishing the models, display the accuracy scores achieved by each model, and compare the results.
Save each of your alternative models as an HDF5 file.
